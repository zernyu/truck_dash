# ESP32 Bluetooth Audio Relay - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

**Product Name:** ESP32 Bluetooth Audio Hub  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** August 2025  
**Project Type:** Hardware/Firmware Development  

### 1.1 Purpose
Create a Bluetooth audio relay device using ESP32 that allows multiple phones to connect simultaneously to a single legacy Bluetooth speaker that only supports one connection at a time.

### 1.2 Target Use Case
Primary use in car environments where multiple passengers want to share control of a Bluetooth speaker without manual device switching.

## 2. Core Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

**FR-001: Multi-Device Connection**
- ESP32 must accept simultaneous Bluetooth connections from multiple phones (target: 2-4 devices)
- Each connected device should appear as a valid audio output option

**FR-002: Single Speaker Connection**
- ESP32 must maintain one stable connection to the target Bluetooth speaker
- Connection should auto-reconnect if temporarily lost

**FR-003: Audio Source Prioritization**
- System detects first active audio stream and relays it to speaker
- Other audio sources are ignored while first source is active
- When active source stops, system listens for next audio source

**FR-004: Status Indication**
- Use built-in ESP32 LED to indicate system status
- LED patterns for: powered on, connected to speaker, actively relaying audio

### 2.2 Technical Requirements

**TR-001: Hardware**
- Single ESP32 development board (no additional peripherals required)
- USB power supply (5V)
- Operating temperature: -10°C to 60°C (car environment)

**TR-002: Bluetooth Specifications**
- Support Bluetooth Classic A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile)
- Support AVRCP (Audio/Video Remote Control Profile) for basic controls
- Bluetooth version: 4.2 or higher

**TR-003: Audio Quality**
- Maintain original audio quality (no unnecessary compression)
- Latency: <100ms for acceptable user experience
- Support standard audio codecs (SBC minimum)

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Connection Model
```
[Phone 1] ──┐
[Phone 2] ──┼── [ESP32] ── [Bluetooth Speaker]
[Phone 3] ──┘
```

### 3.2 Audio Flow
1. Multiple phones connect to ESP32 as Bluetooth audio clients
2. ESP32 monitors all connections for active audio streams
3. First detected audio stream gets priority
4. ESP32 relays prioritized audio to connected speaker
5. When audio stops, system returns to monitoring state

## 4. User Stories

**US-001:** As a car passenger, I want to connect my phone to the audio system without disconnecting others, so multiple people can easily share music control.

**US-002:** As a driver, I want clear indication of which device is currently playing, so I know the system status without looking away from the road.

**US-003:** As a user, I want automatic switching between devices when one stops playing, so there's no manual intervention needed.

## 5. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Connectivity
- ESP32 connects to single Bluetooth speaker
- Single phone can connect and stream audio
- Basic LED status indication

### Phase 2: Multi-Device Support
- Multiple phones can connect simultaneously
- First-active audio detection and relaying
- Enhanced LED status patterns

### Phase 3: Optimization
- Audio quality improvements
- Connection stability enhancements
- Power management optimization

## 6. Success Criteria

### 6.1 Performance Metrics
- **Connection Success Rate:** >95% for phone-to-ESP32 connections
- **Audio Latency:** <100ms end-to-end
- **Switching Time:** <2 seconds between audio sources
- **Uptime:** >99% during normal operation

### 6.2 User Experience Goals
- Zero manual configuration required
- Intuitive LED status indication
- Seamless audio switching experience
- Stable connections during car operation

## 7. Technical Constraints

### 7.1 Hardware Limitations
- ESP32 processing power and memory constraints
- Built-in Bluetooth stack limitations
- Single LED for all status indication

### 7.2 Bluetooth Protocol Constraints
- A2DP profile limitations
- Codec compatibility between devices
- Bluetooth Classic range and interference

## 8. Risk Assessment

### 8.1 Technical Risks
- **Audio synchronization issues:** Medium risk - Mitigate with proper buffering
- **Bluetooth stack stability:** Medium risk - Use proven ESP-IDF libraries
- **Device compatibility:** High risk - Test with multiple phone models

### 8.2 Implementation Risks
- **Library availability:** Low risk - ESP32 has mature Bluetooth libraries
- **Development complexity:** Medium risk - Well-documented platform
- **Testing scenarios:** Medium risk - Need multiple test devices

## 9. Development Resources

### 9.1 Required Tools
